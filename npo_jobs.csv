About SmartWyred
•	We’re the first to apply AI and data science to e-commerce with the goal of helping everyday buyers find the best deals on the best products. Despite advancements in technology over the past 20 years, the online shopping experience remains extremely outdated, disorganized, and increasingly favors large corporations like Amazon over consumers. SmartWyred aims to level the playing field in the following ways:
o	Aggregation – We aim to feature products from all major online retailers so site users know they’ve left no stone unturned and can save time they might otherwise spend shopping around for the best deal.
o	Valuation – SmartWyred applies sophisticated data analysis where applicable in order to inform buyers of whether they’ve found a good deal. We do so by showing buyer a dollar denominated fair value for each product as an AI estimate of the average price of products with roughly similar specifications.
o	Real-Time Pricing – Unlike product recommendation sites which use static prices, we aim to show consumers up to date prices with real-time feeds.
o	Deal Monitoring – SmartWyred uses all of the above to display the best products at the largest discounts anywhere on the web.
o	Education – We also aim to educate consumers on how they can use our research to gain an advantage over corporate retailers. The SmartWyred blog (https://www.smartwyred.com/blog.php) showcases these findings.
•	SmartWyred was founded in 2018 by two Harvard-trained data scientists, Anthony Genello and Fred Zhang (https://www.smartwyred.com/about.php).
•	The current site build (https://www.smartwyred.com) was bootstrapped without any software engineer help. Now it’s time for a professional overhaul and we would love your help with this next stage of development.
•	We’ve begun by building out a beta product for laptops and PC monitors but we plan to expand broadly since our approach applies well to a wide array of purchasing decisions such as: engagement diamonds, clothing/fashion, cars, and even apartments.


Preferred Qualifications
•	Fluency in a web-based front-end technology such as JavaScript or AJAX.
•	UX intuition and an eye for design
•	Industry experience in the above
•	Training in computer science at the Bachelor’s or Master’s level
•	The desire and discipline to work independently with low management overhead as the sole developer on a project.

Benefits of Working With Us
•	As our first engineer, you’ll have a huge impact on SmartWyred, both on the tech side as well as the product side.
•	You'll be building something meaningful that will give help educate everyday consumers and give them an edge over corporate e-retailers in a groundbreaking way.
•	After this next stage of engineering, you’ll be at the top of our list for additional development projects as well as full-time hiring in the future.

Application Instructions
•	Please reply to this posting with your resume.
•	If you'd like, you can also include a cover letter, GitHub profile, Hacker News profile, any project pages showing off your work, or other portfolio.
•	Application is on a rolling basis so please apply as soon as you can.    "

Apprentice Entrepreneur

If you are passionate about entrepreneurship, always wanted to start your own company but don’t know how or haven’t had your brilliant idea yet, this is the job posting for you.  We are looking employee #1 for a startup looking to disrupt the real estate industry.  As an apprentice entrepreneur, you will be mentored and work closely with a successful entrepreneur who is a Harvard grad, started four companies, raised over $30M+ of VC funding, and expert at software development, sales, and marketing.
This position is not the typical corporate ladder type job.  It is NOT a stepping stone to graduate school or another job.  If you are not sure what you want to do with your life and want a good ""learning"" experience, then this is NOT the position for you.  We want super ambitious people preferably from humble backgrounds who want to rule the world.
Requirements:
- Recent graduate who has excelled in life (went to a top-tier school, did something unique and amazing, etc…)
- Attention to detail to the point of being annal.  What was spelled wrong here?  Did that bother you?
- Can’t stand being part of the machine... you want to build the machine.
- Hungry to succeed and willing to go all-in to make it happen!
- Genius software developer who wants to learn the business side.  However, if you are smart, we are willing to teach you how to code as well (we’ve done this successfully with others).  By the end of this experience, you will be able to Amazon, Yelp, Zillow, etc… from scratch
- Willing to work for $40k for the first year, scale to $100k+ within 12-18 months, and hopefully become a millionaire.  If the business doesn’t get to that level, there will be opportunities to work on another business idea or join the entrepreneur’s current successful company
The ideal candidate must be an entrepreneur at heart and have had dreams of running their own company since childhood.  You must have the creativity to come up with new ideas, have the technical chops to build it, the business acumen to market it and management skills to build a team to support it.  Most of all you must be a perfectionist and results oriented.
You'll be working hard for sure, but you'll also learn a tremendous amount and get to experience the joys and challenges of working in a fast-paced and highly entrepreneurial internet company.  If you consider yourself in the top %1 of entrepreneurs, then please send your resume and why you think you would be good a fit.
