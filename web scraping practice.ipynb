      "â¢\tWeâre the first to apply AI and data science to e-commerce with the goal of helping everyday buyers find the best deals on the best products. Despite advancements in technology over the past 20 years, the online shopping experience remains extremely outdated, disorganized, and increasingly favors large corporations like Amazon over consumers. SmartWyred aims to level the playing field in the following ways:\n",
      "o\tAggregation â We aim to feature products from all major online retailers so site users know theyâve left no stone unturned and can save time they might otherwise spend shopping around for the best deal.\n",
      "o\tValuation â SmartWyred applies sophisticated data analysis where applicable in order to inform buyers of whether theyâve found a good deal. We do so by showing buyer a dollar denominated fair value for each product as an AI estimate of the average price of products with roughly similar specifications.\n",
      "o\tReal-Time Pricing â Unlike product recommendation sites which use static prices, we aim to show consumers up to date prices with real-time feeds.\n",
      "o\tDeal Monitoring â SmartWyred uses all of the above to display the best products at the largest discounts anywhere on the web.\n",
      "o\tEducation â We also aim to educate consumers on how they can use our research to gain an advantage over corporate retailers. The SmartWyred blog (https://www.smartwyred.com/blog.php) showcases these findings.\n",

      "â¢\tThe current site build (https://www.smartwyred.com) was bootstrapped without any software engineer help. Now itâs time for a professional overhaul and we would love your help with this next stage of development.\n",
      "â¢\tWeâve begun by building out a beta product for laptops and PC monitors but we plan to expand broadly since our approach applies well to a wide array of purchasing decisions such as: engagement diamonds, clothing/fashion, cars, and even apartments.\n",

      "About SmartWyred\n",
      "â¢\tWeâre the first to apply AI and data science to e-commerce with the goal of helping everyday buyers find the best deals on the best products. Despite advancements in technology over the past 20 years, the online shopping experience remains extremely outdated, disorganized, and increasingly favors large corporations like Amazon over consumers. SmartWyred aims to level the playing field in the following ways:\n",
      "o\tAggregation â We aim to feature products from all major online retailers so site users know theyâve left no stone unturned and can save time they might otherwise spend shopping around for the best deal.\n",
      "o\tValuation â SmartWyred applies sophisticated data analysis where applicable in order to inform buyers of whether theyâve found a good deal. We do so by showing buyer a dollar denominated fair value for each product as an AI estimate of the average price of products with roughly similar specifications.\n",
      "o\tReal-Time Pricing â Unlike product recommendation sites which use static prices, we aim to show consumers up to date prices with real-time feeds.\n",
      "o\tDeal Monitoring â SmartWyred uses all of the above to display the best products at the largest discounts anywhere on the web.\n",
      "o\tEducation â We also aim to educate consumers on how they can use our research to gain an advantage over corporate retailers. The SmartWyred blog (https://www.smartwyred.com/blog.php) showcases these findings.\n",
      "â¢\tSmartWyred was founded in 2018 by two Harvard-trained data scientists, Anthony Genello and Fred Zhang (https://www.smartwyred.com/about.php).\n",
      "â¢\tThe current site build (https://www.smartwyred.com) was bootstrapped without any software engineer help. Now itâs time for a professional overhaul and we would love your help with this next stage of development.\n",
      "â¢\tWeâve begun by building out a beta product for laptops and PC monitors but we plan to expand broadly since our approach applies well to a wide array of purchasing decisions such as: engagement diamonds, clothing/fashion, cars, and even apartments.\n",
